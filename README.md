# Iterative QLS for CFD

Python implementation of the "Iterative Quantum Linear Solver" --- proposed by [Zhao-Yun Chen _et al._](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2024.117428) --- as presentation for the 2024 course of "Quantum Computing" at Politecnico di Torino.

## Dependecies
- `numpy` for matrix/vector operations
- `qiskit` for quantum circuit creation and execution
